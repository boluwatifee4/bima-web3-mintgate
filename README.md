## Introduction

CreatorVault is a web3 application that enables creators to offer exclusive digital downloads gated by token ownership. This project allows creators to control access to their content, providing a secure and verifiable way to distribute digital assets to their community. This specific implementation is designed for the testnet environment.

Key features include:

*   **Token-Gated Access:** Restrict access to digital downloads based on the ownership of specific tokens (NFTs).
*   **Web3 Integration:** Built using web3 technologies for secure and decentralized access control.
*   **Frontend Interface:** A user-friendly frontend built with Next.js for easy interaction.

## Installation

To get started with CreatorVault, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>  # Replace with the actual repository URL
    cd bima-web3-mintgate
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

    ```
    CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<your_contract_address>
    ALCHEMY_API_KEY=<your_alchemy_api_key>
    ```

    *   `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of your deployed smart contract.  (See the `deploy:testnet` script in `package.json` for deployment instructions).
    *   `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`: Your Alchemy API key for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

4.  **Deploy the smart contract (Testnet):**

    ```bash
    npm run deploy:testnet
    ```
    This command executes the `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh` script, which handles the deployment of the smart contract to a testnet.  Ensure you have the necessary tooling (e.g., Foundry) installed and configured.

## Usage

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev:web
    ```

    This command starts the Next.js development server for the frontend.  The application will be accessible in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).

2.  **Connect your wallet:**

    Use a Web3-enabled wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to connect to the application.

3.  **Verify Token Ownership:**

    The application checks if the connected wallet owns the required token(s) to access the gated content.

4.  **Download Digital Assets:**

    If the user owns the required token(s), they will be granted access to download the digital assets.

## Features

*   **Token-Gated Downloads:** Securely restrict access to digital downloads based on token ownership.
*   **Frontend Interface:** User-friendly interface built with Next.js and RainbowKit for easy interaction.
*   **Web3 Integration:** Utilizes web3 technologies for secure and decentralized access control.
*   **Testnet Deployment:** Designed for deployment and testing on Ethereum testnets.
*   **Responsive Design:** The frontend is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.
